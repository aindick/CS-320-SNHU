This is a repository for my work in CS 320 Software Test Automation &amp; QA.

- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  
  When it comes to checking if a program is secure and functional, testing is a good way to do that. JUnit tests have helped me to make sure my programs are running properly and are secure. Continuous integragtion (CI) tools are a great way for programmers to test their code and save time. There are also many choice in CI tools besides JUnit that a programmer can choose such as Jenkins and CircleCI.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  Interpretting user needs can be difficult. As a developer, it is helpful to ask the client questions about the program they want. But sometimes clients don't even know complwtely what they want so it might take some guesswork to come up with the right solution. It is a good idea to break the needs of the user into small pieces and implement them one by one into code vs. trying to tackle it all at once. 
  
- How do I approach designing software?

  When designing software, it is a good idea to first know what you are building for the user. This can help with guiding you to the right tools like what programming language would be best given the prompt from the user, what CI tools would be best, what libraries to use, etc. If the client really has no idea what they'd want for the design, you can always present an idea you have already to help them figure out what they'd prefer. With assignments I've had in the past, what I'd do is first start with the very important features that are needed, and then work on the less important "extra credit" features if time allowed. This method could also help developers to prioritze what the software needs in each design vs. having too much fluffy stuff added and causing confusion.
